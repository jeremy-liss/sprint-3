My site's primary purpose is to display my EDA coursework and demonstrate the coding skills I've learnt.

My target audience is other coding students and teachers and those wanting to see my work - such as employers.

I would like site visitors to be easily able to find relevant blog posts and to get a sense of my personal interests and style of coding/design.

I will build my site following the 'F' layout, with my information in the top left, links to blogs going across the page underneath this, and a link to an about me section in the bottom left. On the mobile site it will be down to one column with my information at the top and links to blogs underneath this.
