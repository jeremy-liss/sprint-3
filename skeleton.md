When the window is resized to less than 550px the columns change from being different fractions of the max-width to all being 100% of the width. This is done by creating a media query - the media query states that on devices with a min-width of 550px, each column type takes up a certain fraction of the row. If the device has a display less than this then the rule doesn't apply, therefore all columns will be the full width.
